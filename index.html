# New Approach

## Connect devices from Webpage directly!

---

class: middle

# [WoT.JS](http://wotjs.io)

## A library provides Web Components to control devices.

---

# Concepts in WoT.JS

* Every device is represented as a DOM element in a Web page.
* A WoT app is just a Web app, hackers can control multiple devices in it.
* Only JavaScript code, no native(C/C++) code to build a WoT app.

# Sample Code

HTML
```
&ltweb-arduino id="arduino" device-name="DEVICE">&lt/web-arduino>
```

JavaScript
```
var arduino = document.querySelector('#arduino');
arduino.addEventListener('ready', function() {
  var led = arduino.Led(7);
  led.on();
});
```
